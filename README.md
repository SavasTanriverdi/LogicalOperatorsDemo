# LogicalOperatorsDemo

This Java project demonstrates how to use logical operators such as `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) in various scenarios. The project covers the use of these operators in conditional statements and explains how to combine multiple conditions using logical operators.

## Key Features:
- Demonstrates the use of logical AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`)
- Combines multiple conditions in if-else statements
- Uses boolean variables and expressions to evaluate logical operations

## Usage:
Run the main class to see examples of logical operators in action. Modify the input values and conditions to test how logical operators work in different scenarios.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
